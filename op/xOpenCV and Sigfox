$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y

$ sudo reboot

Note that the default password is "raspberry"

Now go the "Menu" -> "Preferences" -> "Raspberry Pi Configuration" and go the "Interfaces" tab

We need to enable:

- Camera
- SSH
- I2C
- SPI

Get the source files

Clone the project's repository:

https://github.com/luisomoreau/sigfox_face_recogni...

$ sudo git clone https://github.com/luisomoreau/sigfox_face_recogni...

Step 3: Plug the LCD Display
https://github.com/luisomoreau/sigfox_face_recognition
https://github.com/luisomoreau/sigfox_face_recognition.git

Installation

I cloned the https://github.com/youngage/grove-lcd python libraries under the lcd/ folder in the project's files

Run in the terminal:

$ sudo apt-get install python-smbus

$ sudo apt-get install i2c-tools

Test

To test if the LCD display works fine, go to the project's folder and run the lcd/backlight.py script:

$ sudo python lcd/backlight.py

The result should be like the following video:

Install OpenCV

We are going to use the OpenCV python libraries. At first, I tried to compile it myself but I couldn't really make it. I spent hours trying different tutorials but with no success.

Finally, I found that OpenCV could be installed using apt-get. I read that few features are missing but at least it is enough for what we want to do!

(https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f...)

Open your terminal again and run:

$ sudo apt-get install python-dev

$ sudo apt-get install python-opencv

$ sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev

$ sudo pip install imutils

$ sudo pip install numpy

However, if you wish to compile it yourself, feel free to have a look at pyimage website: http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/02/23/install-op...

It can be a bit long, though.

Test the installation

In your terminal run:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python
Python 2.7.9 (default, Mar 8 2015, 00:52:26) [GCC 4.9.2] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> import cv2

>>>

If you don't see any errors, OpenCV has been installed correctly.

Now press ctrl + d to exit
